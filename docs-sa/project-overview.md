## Executive Summary

**Vision:** Establish Source Agents as Soroban's flagship consumer entertainment IP—proving blockchain can support culturally rich, narratively compelling games where Web3 integration enhances rather than dominates the experience.

**Differentiation:** 
- First narrative-driven gaming franchise native to Soroban
- Three distinct genres unified by coherent lore and security themes
- Characters originate from Soroban tutorial documentation (Alice, Bob/Byron, Carol)
- Genre variety attracts diverse player demographics while building shared universe
- Educational without being pedagogical—players experience security mindsets through gameplay

**Market Positioning:** Premium indie games with blockchain benefits (true ownership, persistent state, verifiable achievements) rather than crypto-games with forced tokenomics.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Soroban ecosystem immaturity (tooling, infrastructure)  
**Mitigation:** Build on proven tools (React, Phaser), contribute to ecosystem development, maintain flexibility to adapt as platform evolves

**Risk:** Smart contract vulnerabilities  
**Mitigation:** Minimal on-chain logic, thorough audits, bug bounty program, progressive rollout

**Risk:** Scalability issues with on-chain state  
**Mitigation:** Hybrid architecture (off-chain gameplay, on-chain key moments), optimize gas usage, use indexers for queries

### Market Risks

**Risk:** Low Web3 gaming adoption  
**Mitigation:** Design for gameplay-first (can play without wallet), target indie game audience, free-to-play core

**Risk:** Blockchain negative perception  
**Mitigation:** Emphasize quality gameplay, avoid crypto jargon in marketing, demonstrate genuine utility over speculation

**Risk:** Competition from established franchises  
**Mitigation:** Differentiation through Soroban-native identity, genre diversity, narrative depth, community-first approach

### Execution Risks

**Risk:** Scope creep (three game series is ambitious)  
**Mitigation:** Phased rollout, start with ALICE minimum viable product, iterate based on feedback, extend only after validation

**Risk:** Narrative consistency across series  
**Mitigation:** Story Bible as canonical reference, single creative lead for lore, community lore council for major decisions

**Risk:** Solo/small team bandwidth  
**Mitigation:** Open-source components, community contributions, targeted contractor hires for specialized needs, strategic partnerships

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Blockchain Gaming Context

**Current State:**
- Most Web3 games are DeFi gamification or play-to-earn models
- Few prioritize narrative or single-player experiences
- Soroban specifically lacks consumer entertainment applications
- Quality gap between traditional indie games and crypto-games

**Source Agents Position:**
- Premium indie quality with blockchain benefits
- Narrative-first, not finance-first
- Multi-genre franchise vs. single-game projects
- Platform-exclusive (Soroban) vs. multi-chain generic

### Comparable Projects (Not Direct Competitors)

**Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained, etc.:**
- Multiplayer competitive focus
- Token economies central to design
- Different audience and value proposition

**Crypto RPGs (various):**
- Often generic fantasy settings
- Blockchain mechanics forced into gameplay
- Source Agents: original IP, blockchain enhances, doesn't define

**Traditional Indie Narrative Games:**
- High quality but no ownership/persistence
- Can't carry progress across games
- Source Agents offers this while matching quality

---

## Open Questions & Future Exploration

**Governance:**
- Should Source Agents have a DAO for community decisions?
- How much creative control should players have over future lore?
- Balancing community input with narrative coherence

**Expansion:**
- Which new characters (DIANA, ETHAN, etc.) should be prioritized?
- When to pursue studio partnerships vs. stay indie?
- How to scale while maintaining quality and vision?

**Monetization Optimization:**
- Ideal NFT pricing for accessibility vs. sustainability?
- Premium content models that don't feel extractive?
- Tournament prize pools funded how (entry fees, sponsorships, grants)?

**Cross-Chain:**
- Should Source Agents ever expand beyond Soroban?
- If yes, how to maintain Soroban-first identity?
- Cross-chain bridges for NFTs/achievements?

---

## Conclusion

**Source Agents positions itself at the intersection of premium indie gaming, Web3 innovation, and cultural IP development.** By building on Soroban's strengths (security, low costs, institutional trust), leveraging characters from the platform's own documentation, and delivering genre-diverse games unified by coherent lore, the franchise demonstrates that blockchain gaming can be narratively rich, mechanically engaging, and genuinely fun—not just financially speculative.

**Three characters. Three genres. Three security disciplines. One universe.**

The network needs defenders. The defenders need stories. And the stories need players who truly own them.

**Welcome to Source Agents.**
